I am currently pursuing my PhD in Economics from CSRD, JNU. I have completed my MPhil in Economics from the same centre on the question of wage discrimination. 

Previously, I did Masters in Development and Labour Studies at JNU. During my masters, I was involved in two research projects, ‘Employment, Working and Livelihood Conditions of the Migrant Workers from Bihar in the Informal Sector in NCR’, and another on the oral histories of the Warli Adivasi Movement, which has been recently published as a monograph, Red Flag of the Warlis published by LeftWord. I was also involved in documenting the history of the trade union movement in the banking sector which has been published as a monograph, Struggling for Nation Building: A Brief History of All India Bank Officers’ Confederation published by Aakar Books. 

Currently, my research interests concern the question of wages and social inequality in the context of contemporary India. I have also been involved in the student movement at JNU and had served as the Vice-President of the JNU Students’ Union in 2018-19.
